> [!WARNING]
> **Unofficial fork: RetroScaler 4 ports adapter support**
>
> This fork adds support for the RetroScaler 4 ports BlueRetro adapters (N64, Dreamcast & GameCube versions with 4 BT LEDs).
> It is not affiliated with, endorsed by or supported by the original BlueRetro author or by RetroScaler.
>
> RetroScaler ships these adapters with modified BlueRetro firmware but without its source code.
> The changes in this fork were reconstructed by reverse engineering their firmware binaries.
> Built with ESP-IDF v5.4 on top of upstream commit `ddfc31b`, these changes reproduce the RetroScaler app images byte-for-byte (except build time, version string & hashes).
> In this fork they are applied on top of the final upstream release.
>
> Changes compared to upstream BlueRetro:
> * 4 BT status LEDs on GPIO 14, 32, 33 & 25: a LED turns on once the matching BT device is identified and off when it disconnects (`CONFIG_BLUERETRO_RETROSCALER_4LED`).
> * Default accessories mode set to rumble (`CONFIG_BLUERETRO_DEFAULT_ACC_RUMBLE`).
> * Build configs: `configs/hw1/n64_retroscaler`, `configs/hw1/dreamcast_retroscaler` & `configs/hw1/gamecube_retroscaler`.
>
> **Tested successfully** on the RetroScaler 4 ports N64, Dreamcast & GameCube adapters.
>
> **Download:** prebuilt firmware is available on the [Releases](https://github.com/opssemnik/Blueretro-for-retroscaler-4port/releases) page.
> * `*_full.bin` is a full flash image, the same layout as the RetroScaler images: flash it at **0x0** (e.g. NodeMCU flasher default settings).
> * `*_app.bin` is the app only: flash it at **0x10000**. Flashing it at 0x0 overwrites the bootloader and the adapter won't boot.
> * Flashing a full image erases saved settings & BT pairings.
>
> **Build**, e.g. for N64: `cp configs/hw1/n64_retroscaler sdkconfig && idf.py reconfigure build` (ESP-IDF v5.4).
> This produces both `build/BlueRetro.bin` (app, 0x10000) and `build/BlueRetro_full.bin` (full image, 0x0).
>
> Both options are off by default, so the stock configs build the same firmware as upstream.
> Use at your own risk. Please do not report issues with this fork to the upstream project.

After 6 years working on BlueRetro, the time has come for me to move on
and focus on my family and my real job.

The code remains available as-is for reference, learning, and community use,
but no new features, bug fixes, or pull requests will be accepted.

Thank you to everyone who contributed, tested, reported issues,
or supported the project over the years.
Your involvement made BlueRetro what it is today.

If you are looking to build upon this work, please feel free to

Thank you,
